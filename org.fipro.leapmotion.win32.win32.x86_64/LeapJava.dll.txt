You need to replace this file with the LeapJava.dll archive from the Leap Motion Developer SDK.

You can download it via https://developer.leapmotion.com/ after you successfully created an account
and signed the SDK Aggreement.

Because of the SDK Agreement I am not allowed to publish contents of the SDK in any way.
That includes of course the JAR and the DLL files. So if you cloned this repo and want to get it
to work, you need to put the necessary files into the projects manually.

You can find the LeapJava.dll file in the following folder after you downloaded and extracted the archive:

LeapDeveloperKit/LeapSDK/lib/x64/LeapJava.dll
