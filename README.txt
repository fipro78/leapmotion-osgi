Eclipse 4 plugins to get Leap Motion into an Eclipse application

Note that the necessary Leap Motion SDK fragments (JAR and DLL files) are not included
in this repo. Instead you will find txt-files that have the same name with an additional
txt-file-extension to indicate where to put which file from the Leap Motion SDK.

You need to sign up as a Leap Motion developer, sign the SDK Agreement and download
and extract the Leap Motion SDK if you have not done so already.

In order to make the plugins work, you need to copy the necessary files from the
Leap Motion SDK to the appropriate locations in the plugins. The txt files contain
information about where to find the correct files.

For more information about this plugins have a look at my blog post here:
